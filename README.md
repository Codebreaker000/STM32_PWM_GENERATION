# STM32_PWM_GENERATION
Here We are Using STM32 TImer and Generate a PWM Signal With Required Frequency.

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a widely used technique in embedded systems and electronics for efficiently controlling analog-like signals, such as motor speed, LED brightness, or audio volume, using digital microcontrollers. PWM signals are essentially square waveforms where the duty cycle (percentage of time the signal is high) determines the average voltage level applied to a device. This method allows precise control of devices by varying the duty cycle while keeping the signal's frequency constant.

In microcontrollers like those from the STM32 family, PWM generation is commonly achieved using hardware timers. These timers are versatile peripherals that can count time intervals, trigger events, and, most importantly, produce PWM signals with high accuracy. By configuring the timers appropriately, you can tailor the PWM waveform to suit your specific application requirements.
